Welcome to the react-archi template documentation based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Why react-archi ?

This template is based on a personnal need when I build a new react project.
react-archi is principally composed of Typecript + ChakraUI. Please look at the architecture part for details on how to use it.

## Usage

To use this template within your project, add `--template react-archi` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template react-archi

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template react-archi
```

## Architecture

The goal at the startup of the project was to create a clean architecture, scalable and easily testable. Cut everything and structure folders to find quickly and add features easily.

Coming soon !

## Good practices

Coming soon !

## What's next ?

I would like to create same template but with different packages like by adding a redux starter or replacing chakraUI by MUI.
