# react-archi

Welcome to the react-archi template documentation based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Please if you have any advice, problem or need. Open an issue and we can talk about it :)

## Why react-archi ?

This template is based on a personnal need when I build a new react project.
I will try to make multiple templates with the same architecture but multiple packages variations.

## Usage

To use this template within your project, add `--template *template-name*` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript-chakra

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript-chakra
```
"template-name" is the subfolder name from the repo based on your needs

## Architecture

The goal at the startup of the project was to create a clean architecture, scalable and easily testable. Cut everything and structure folders to find quickly and add features easily.

Coming soon !

## Good practices

Coming soon !

## What's next ?

I would like to create same template but with different packages like by adding a redux starter or replacing chakraUI by MUI or adding redux...
